# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-21)

**Core value:** Sarah builds workflows in plain language and trusts the agent to run them — most operator work happens without her in the loop, and she reviews only what genuinely needs her judgment.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — foundation — prove the agent

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-22 -- Phase 02 planning complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet
- Trend: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap mirrors PRD phasing (Week 0 → Phase 1 → 2 → 3) — phases ladder up trust and ship value incrementally
- Existing docs (PRD/IA/systems/data/tech) are the locked source of truth — planning does not re-litigate stack, IA, or phasing
- Build scope = v1 MVP only — v1 proves the wedge; v2/v3 expand the moat afterward
- [01-04] getClaims() returns {data: {claims}|null} not {data: {claims}} — destructure data first; RESEARCH.md pattern corrected in implementation
- [01-04] validateNextParam rejects absolute and protocol-relative next params in OAuth callback — open-redirect guard (T-1-04-04)
- [01-04] vitest.config.mts must exclude tests/e2e/** — Playwright test() conflicts with Vitest globals

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pricing required before beta (PRD §8.3 open item — out of scope for build but needed pre-GA)
- Mobile detailed design pass still needed (PRD flag — Phase 4 work will unblock this)
- SOC 2 / threat model / pen test tracked separately, required before GA
